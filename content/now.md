What's happening right now, as of September 14, 2021.

## Work

I've been working in [Glia](https://www.glia.com/) for almost 17 months.

My life-long journey to becoming a good engineer is currently focused on accruing credit to be promoted to Senior Engineer 2. To get there, I need to prove greater autonomy in solving large problems.

## Sports

I am mostly practicing yoga. Temperatures are getting lower and the light is fading away.

## Books

- [My Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/sturmer) says all about what I'm reading these days. I'm usually glad to accept friend requests if we know each other.
- The first book I've owned was _Treasure Island_. I'm not sure I've ever read it all. It was the unexpected and unwelcome gift of some idiot family friend who, however, actually made a good gift. I had just turned 8.
- [I've read 300+ books](https://www.librarything.com/catalog/sturmer) between August 5, 1989 and today - click the link and select the "Read" filter.

Bonus: I have a [TinyCat page](https://www.librarycat.org/lib/sturmer)

## Me (a.k.a. The Mug)

This is a recent picture of me:
