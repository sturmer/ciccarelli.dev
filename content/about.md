## The website

I have come to like static website generators, because they allow me to follow a workflow more similar to developing software, and the generated pages render extremely fast. I write my content in Markdown.

Tools I've used to create this website:

- April 2021: [nanoc](https://nanoc.ws/).
- February 2020:  [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com).
- Between 2017 and 2021, this entire website was generated using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). For details about my workflow, read [this](/blog/generating-gergelim-using-hexo/).
- Until December 2017, I generated it using [Frog](https://github.com/greghendershott/frog).
- Before that, it used to run as a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) app with:
	- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/)
	- [Express](https://expressjs.com/), a Web framework for Node.js
	- [Jade](https://jade-lang.com/), a Node template engine to generate the HTML
	- [Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/), a CSS preprocessor

_Gergelim_ is the Portuguese word for _Sesame_.

## Me

I am a software engineer in love with the process, not with the goal.

I believe in the value of Open Source software as an expression of freedom and creativity. Most if not all of my contributions are on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/sturmer).

My public GPG key is [0x39BBDB6C](/about/keygpg/).

I tweet from [@increatore](https://twitter.com/increatore), mostly about programming and books.

Most of what I've read is [here](https://www.librarycat.org/lib/sturmer).
